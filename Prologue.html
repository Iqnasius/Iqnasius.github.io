    <p>Ah, it's you</p>

    <p>
        It's been a long time since we've last seen each other. <br>
        During this time... you've been teetering on the edge of a cliff. <br>
        You may have forgotten who you are, but just remembering your name is enough. <br>
        ...It's time. Don't linger here for too long. <br>
        After all, you aren't my guest yet, nor should you even be here. <br>
        She still needs you. <br>
        December 23rd. <br>
        You may not remember what this date means to you. <br>
        And this will thrust you into peril.

                                 Medic, how's doctor doing?
                                 But, just a moment ago... we were holding hands...
                                 So why... why is Doctor still not waking up...?

<b>Medic</b>                       Amiya! Don't panic, just calm down first!

<b>Amiya</b>                      Ah....S-sorry.

<b>Medic</b>                      You always get so flustered when it comes to the doctor.
                                But, Amiya, if the worst came to pass... what would you do then?

<b>Amiya</b>                     ...I'm already mentally prepared for that. We would continue to follow the plan.

<b>Medic</b>                     ...I understand. Anyway, I'll do what you requested.

<b>Amiya</b>                     All right... I appreciate it.
                                About the Doctor...

<b>Medic</b>                     Don't worry, Amiya. All the vital sign are stable now.
                               I'll do one more inspection, just for you.

<b>Amiya</b>                    Thank you... Thank you very much!

<b>Medic</b>                    Mhm. Breathing is slightly shallow, but blood pressure is normal. There should be no cause 
                               for concern.

                                Amiya, it's a success! The Doctor has woken up!

<b>Amiya</b>	                Doctor...?
                                I'm so happy... Doctor...

<b>Medic</b>	                Ah, careful! You mustn't do that...
                                Don't try to move yet. Your body still hasn't fully adapted to this.

<b>Amiya</b>	                Doctor...?

<b>Doctor</b>	                Who... are you?

<b>Amiya</b>	                Ah, Doctor... It's me...

<b>Doctor</b>	                ...Who... am I...?

<b>Amiya</b>	                You...

                                You're the most important person to me.
                                Doctor... you don't remember?

<b>Doctor</b>                   ...Can i trust you?

<b>Amiya</b>                    ...
                               I understand. I know this is a bit much to take in right now.
                               I don't expect you to remember everything right away, and I'm not asking you to trust me right now.

<b>Doctor</b>                   ...

<b>Amiya</b>                   Doctor, do you really not remember me at all?
                              ...
                              Even if that's the case... i won't give up.
                              We've already sacrified so much, just to find you...

<b>Doctor</b>                  I see, Pleased to meet you, Amiya.

<b>Amiya</b>                   Ah, um, hello.
                             ...
                             I, I don't know how to put this, but so many things have changed from before.
                             That includes me as well.
    
<b>Amiya</b>	            However, you'll always be the most important person to me, Doctor. No matter what happens, this will never change.
                            So that's why, please... give me a little more time.
                            However little it might be...
                             
<b>Doctor</b>                 ...
                             
<b>Medic</b>                   Does the doctor... really have amnesia?
<b>Amiya</b>            	     ...
                             I'm sure everything will be fine if we give Doctor some space...
                            
<b>Doctor</b>                  Where is this...

<b>Amiya</b>	              It's safe hereâ€”
